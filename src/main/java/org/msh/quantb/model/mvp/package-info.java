/**
 * This package contains ModelFactory.java. This class contains common factory methods for each 
 * Java content interface and Java element interface 
 * generated in the org.msh.quantb.model.* packages. 
 * <p>An ModelFactory allows you to programatically 
 * construct new instances of the Java representation 
 * for XML content. The Java representation of XML 
 * content can consist of schema derived interfaces 
 * and classes representing the binding of schema 
 * type definitions, element declarations and model 
 * groups.  Factory methods for each of these are 
 * provided in the ModelFactory class.
